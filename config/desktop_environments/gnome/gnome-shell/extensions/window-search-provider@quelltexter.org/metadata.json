Type\nwindows key, then start typing to find your window.  It will fuzzy-match\napplication name and window title like you might know from\n[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](http://atom.io).\nCurrent algorithm does not yet order the matches by best score.\n\nIf you start your search with a \"/\", it will interprete all search terms\n(separated by whitespace) as regular expressions, which have to match all.",
